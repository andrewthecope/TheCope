@@Title=“Keep Moving” in 2018
@@Date=Thursday, 04 January 2018



In the grand scheme of my life, 2018 is set to be a big one. 

 Sitting here right now, I already know that this year I’ll graduate college, move somewhere new, and start a big-boy job (more on that another time).  The opportunity is to set some year-long goals that can bridge the gap between these disparate segments—to provide confidence during a potentially turbulent transition. 

This is why I’ve decided to focus on a theme for the year rather than a concrete resolution. I’ve decided on the theme of **Keep Moving**. It sounds like a dumb corporate weight loss initiative, but allow me to explain myself.

The people I admire the most are those who don’t stand still. Those who work seemingly tirelessly in pursuit of their passion. Those who end up making things while I sit on my butt, tired from doing nothing.  I am similar to those people more than I am dissimilar, but I have more downtime. 

Strictly speaking, this is not about productivity.  There are a million things that I want to do, like watching more movies and cooking better meals, that I consider meaningful but have nothing to do with an update to my iOS app.  I believe the crux of this theme is the basic notion that *an object in motion stays in motion*. Remaining in motion by washing the dishes after dinner will make me more likely to later work on homework or edit a podcast episode. This is taken directly from my mom, who often spends her weekend break from her busy job doing chores and working in the garden. When I inevitably ask her “Mom why don’t you just RELAX?” she’ll quickly say “there’s a few things I’d like to get done, so I gotta keep moving.” 

  There's plenty of things I want to get done in 2018, so I'll also keep moving. 

In the event I have something interesting to add about my theme of *Keep Moving*, I’ll document it here (writing on this blog definitely counts toward my Keep Moving goal). We’ll see if that ever happens, but in the meantime…

Time to start moving.
