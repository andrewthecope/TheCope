@@Title=Prelude to a Summer of Fun
@@Date=Monday, 18 June 2018


I have a few months off before I start my new job in August. I have purposely made no specific plans, and I intend to make the most of it. I'm calling this **Andrew Cope's Summer of Fun**, and I'm quite excited.  

This summer is not strictly about having fun, but rather taking full advantage of this opportunity to do creative work, learn new things, gain new experiences, and cultivate relationships.  I hope to use this time to form conclusions that may be useful in my new life as a workin'-boy. 

## Maintain the Flame

As I type this right now, I have this underlying spark of motivation. In the past, I've struggled to keep this motivation burning as I get bored and burnt-out.  So I hereby state that the fundamental principle of my Summer of Fun is *Maintain the Flame*.   I want to monitor my inner motivation in hopes of keeping it alive.  This isn't strictly about productivity in my personal projects, but rather a metric for which to optimize in order to maximize my happiness and [generosity](http://thecope.net/2018/4/15/generouswithmytime). 

But, of course, making up a catchy phrase like *maintain the flame* is easy. The hard part is actually doing it. But I have the opportunity this summer to try things out without any real responsibilities getting in my way, so I'm optimistic.  While drinking my coffee this morning, I brainstormed some general principles to help *maintain the flame*:

### Principle 1: Prioritize being around people

While I generally find people who talk about being introverted or extroverted to be insufferable (don't even get me started on the [introverted extrovert](https://www.buzzfeed.com/genamourbarrett/things-you-know-if-youre-an-extrovert-but-also-a-little?utm_term=.mfdeye251#.jujG3GRbX) people), something these folks usually bring up when discussing personality types is the idea that some activities energize you while others exhaust you. For me personally, I find that I am generally more energized after being around people. It's not a hard and fast rule, but it's something I have observed about myself which is relevant to this discussion.  So when given the choice between doing an activity with another human or hanging alone, I ought to prioritize being social.

### Principle 2: Stay Flexible

Next, I believe it is better to keep my plans fluid and flexible. I want to make the most out of this summer, but don't want it to be completely planned ahead of time. I will try to only plan a day or so in advance. This will allow me to go on spontaneous adventures and allow me to do the things that are fun in the moment based on my current mood and energy level.

Similarly, in the realm of personal projects, I should pick short projects that are ideally achievable in a single day. This way I won't get bogged down with a month-long project that deter me from picking up something new and interesting on a whim. 

### Principle 3: Find Sustainable Routines

I also hope to find some kind of consistency in all this freedom. Maintaining some kind of routine will help me stay motivated (&ast;cough cough&ast; maintain the flame ) and energetic. I don't know exactly how this will end up, but I'm looking forward to figuring it out. 

### Principle 4: Remain grateful

And of course, I shouldn't forget how lucky I am to have this opportunity.  Concerning myself with all this unimportant stuff falls very high on [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), and I don't want to lose sight of that. 

It's gonna be a great summer.
