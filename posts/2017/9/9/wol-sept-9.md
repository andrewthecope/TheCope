Gooooood morning folk (and by folks, I mean the completely imaginary people reading this). It's a beautiful day here in Walnut Creek, California, so naturally I plan to hide from the sun and stare at my computer all day.  I have a big project I want to work, and in order to stay focused and work with intention, I'll document what I'm doing on this post with updates every few hours. 

On the docket for today is a web design project I've been thinking about for a while: an online guide to help people get into podcasts. 

Me and my pal [Myah Daniels](http://feelspodcast.com) have been writing the guide over the past couple days, and as that finishes up, I want to design a fancy website to contain our guide. In my coffee fueled state, I'll confess that I have big plans for this website. It's going to be quite over the top. 

But before I start, I have an internal struggle. Should I go on a run this morning? I've been going on a 3 mile run a couple times a week and I was planning on going this morning. But I wanna make a website, dammit! Ahhh, there's not enough hours in the day.

I'm going on the run. I have never wanted to do something less in my life, but it's the right thing to do. I'll just sprint to get this over with.
