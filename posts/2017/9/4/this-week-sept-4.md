@@Title=Three Weeks Left
@@Date=Monday, 04 September 2017


As I sit at my desk writing this, I feel this overwhelming sense of duty to get a million projects finished before the soul-sucking presence of school returns on September 28th. I am very aware that this is my last summer vacation of my life, and I shutter at the thought. There's simply too much I'd like to do before I become a real-life adult with a real-life job and real-life responsibilities. And so my work begins anew. 

I have three full weeks left of summer vacation. This is Week 1.

## Things to Do in Week 1:
- **Finish MetroGnome:** I want to finish an app I started as part of a Blitz a week ago. I don't really intend to release it to the App Store, but I don't want to have it looming over me for the rest of my life. I could easily see myself thinking *"You could probably finish it in a couple hours"* endlessly until I die. 
- **Write about Xcode Storyboards:** Before I went backpacking this weekend, I planned some topics to think about in the absence of internet access. One of these topics was "The Future of Programming". While thinking about this over the weekend, I quickly found it to be too broad. I found the follow-up topic, "The Future of Software Development", to be equally too broad. When I thought about it further, all I really had ideas about were the expansion of Storyboards in iOS development. I hope to present some of my ideas in a post sometime this week.
- **Figure out what it will take to launch Learn Your Lines for Dialogues:** Ugh, the endless project. Just read past posts to read about my over-optimistic expectations about this project.  The whole thing turned out to be much more daunting than I expected. Still, I'm almost finished and would hate for this project to be looming over me forever.
