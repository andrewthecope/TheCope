I'm currently working on a web design project (I'm completely ignoring [my plan](http://www.thecope.net/2017/9/4/this-week-sept-4) for the week). I used to be quite interested in web design, but I've focused on iOS for the past couple of years. I originally thought I'd get back into it without any issue, but boy was I wrong. *Turns out*, things change quite quickly in web technologies. 

All these kids out there will all these newfangled javascript frameworks. They keep me young.
