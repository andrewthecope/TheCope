@@Title=Things to Think About
@@Date=Wednesday, 30 August 2017


Tomorrow I'm leaving for a weekend backpacking trip. Without any devices (and thus, podcasts) I'll only have my own thoughts to keep me entertained. Oh, the horror.

This is a great opportunity for some good deep thinking, though.  With so much time reserved for thinking, I believe it's worthwhile to focus on a narrow set of topics. Without this focus, I could easily spend the whole time thinking about unimportant things like women and how much my feet hurt. 

This list is not set in stone *(just hypertext, amirite?)*, but here's the three things I want to put thought into during the weekend:

1. **The Future of Programming:** How the creation of computer programs will change over time. I believe programming will only become more abstracted with time, as with everything in computing. Inevitably, this will simplify app-making and make it more accessible, but there's plenty of details to consider.  Will we always create programs with text-based programming languages?
 
2. **How to Become a Podcast Listener:** I've been asked by a couple people recently how to start listening to podcasts.  The obvious answer is something like, "Get an app. Find a podcast you like. Go from there", but the details get more complicated. I want to write a comprehensive guide to answer this question. I've gotten Myah Daniels to partner with me in this endeavor, so I'm quite excited about it. It will be helpful to spend some time reflecting on how I started listening to podcasts, and how I've gotten others to join the club. 

3. **Creating a Community of Technical People:** I have tentative plans to teach an iOS Development seminar at UC Davis this upcoming school year. I've wanted to do this for a long time, and *the time is now, the place is here*.  I want these seminars to be a reflection on what I wanted when I was a freshman: technical lessons mixed with an opportunity to make friends and talk about Apple. The goal is to have two people meet at my seminar and go on to make an app with each other.  I believe I could be a decent steward of this, but it will help to think quite a bit about community-building before school starts.
