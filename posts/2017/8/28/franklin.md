@@Title=Inspiration from Ben Franklin
@@Date=Monday, 28 August 2017


I just started reading Walter Isaacson's [biography of Benjamin Franklin](https://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-Franklin-American-Walter-Isaacson/dp/074325807X). I'm only 50 pages into the 600-something page book, but one passage has already struck me:

> In reaction [to his undeveloped writing style], the precocious young teen devised for himself a self-improvement course with the help of a volume of *The Spectator* he found.
> ...
> As part of his self-improvement course, Franklin read the essays, took brief notes, and laid them aside for a few days. Then he tried to recreate the essay in his own words, after which he compared his composition to the original. Sometimes he would jumble up the notes he took, so that he would have to figure out on his own the best order to build the essay's argument.

I find this so remarkable. Benjamin Franklin, who is in the cannon of great American minds, saw limits to his writing abilities when he was young. To tackle this, he self-prescribed lessons to strengthen his persuasive writing skills. 

I've never felt terribly confident in my writing abilities, and I shouldn't be satisfied by that.  I want to try Franklin's self-improvement course. I'll let you know how it goes.
