@@Title=Saturday Blitz: MetroGnome
@@Date=Saturday, 26 August 2017
I'm not particularly busy today, so I figure it's time to BLITZ.

A blitz is when I try to make an entire app in one day. I tried this a few weeks back and I completely failed, but try again I must. 

Today's app idea is called "MetroGnome", a haptic metronome app for the Apple Watch. I have been practicing the piano solo version of Rhapsody in Blue over the past few months, and I've been wanting a metronome watch for the more difficult sections. I own a metronome, but wouldn't it be great to have my watch vibrate to the beat? 

Watch extensions for metronome apps do exist, so first things first, I'm going to check them out.

I'll be back.
