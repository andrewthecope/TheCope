@@Title=Posting Old Projects
@@Date=Thursday, June 29, 2017

Next up on my list of summer technical adventures is posting code from previous projects. Here's what I am setting out to post:

* *Number 2: Social Pooping for the 21st Century:* an iMessage app I made last summer. I wrote about it [here](http://www.thecope.net/2016/11/1/LetUsPoop).

* *Toggl Watch Extension*: An Apple Watch app that interacts with the [Toggl Time Tracking API](https://toggl.com). The extension is not particularly well-made, so I look forward to tearing it apart. I also have a whole half-written post about time-tracking as a life style that I hope to finish. 

* *ACScrollView*: A custom implementation of UIScrollView that allows for quick loading and infinite scrolling. I use this code in Learn Your Lines and I'm quite proud of it. 

It will be a good exercise to go through past projects and analyze what went right and what went wrong. Can't wait.
