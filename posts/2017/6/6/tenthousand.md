@@Title= Learn Your Lines Hits 10,000 Downloads
@@Date=June 6th, 2017

Recently, Learn Your Lines received its 10,000th download. I have almost no analytics in the app, so I can only wonder how many users I actually have, but I’m happy regardless. 

I receive emails all the time reporting bugs and suggesting new features, and I get a big smile with every one. In making the app, I’ve learned so much and hopefully helped people along the way. 

At risk of [repeating myself](http://www.thecope.net/2016/3/3/downloadnumbers) : making stuff is fun, but making stuff *for people* is better.
