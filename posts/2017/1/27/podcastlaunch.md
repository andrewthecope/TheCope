@@Title=How Do You Feel About That?

Podcasts are my favorite medium. As of this writing, I am currently subscribed to 64 podcast feeds. The podcasts I listen to have shaped me into a better person. I firmly believe this. If you are what your friends are, then you certainly are influcenced by the people you invite into your ear holes on a weekly basis. 

Podcasts have the unique ability to inspire, inform, and entertain. So I made a podcast that likely fails to do all three. 

It all started when [Sarah Koenig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Koenig) came to speak at UC Davis. For those of you who don't know, Sarah Koenig is the Beyonc√© of podcasters. Friends of mine were also at event, including my friend [Myah Daniels](https://twitter.com/mdaniels484). We were instantly inspired, biked over to her dorm room, and started recording. 

Turns out that making a podcast is a little more difficult than we thought. The Sarah Koenig event was almost a year ago. It has taken us the whole span of time to make something coherent and sustainable enough to launch. This is why I couldn't be more excited to announce that we are launching our podcast today. It's called "How Do You Feel About That?", and I think you will like it. The premise is simple: Each week one of us presents a topic, and we ask the other, "How do you feel about that?". 

So do me a favor and [give it a listen](http://feels.simplecast.fm/). Ideally, you also [subscribe on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/how-do-you-feel-about-that/id1195466140?mt=2) or the podcast player of choice (if you ask me, everyone should download [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/), but your mileage may vary). 

It is a dream of mine to have a podcast. Dreams do come true, especially when all you have to do to acheive them is record yourself for 10 minutes.
