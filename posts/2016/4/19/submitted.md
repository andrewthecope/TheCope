Be on the lookout for Learn Your Lines 2.0 coming to an iOS device near you whenever Apple gives the OK.

About 15 weeks ago, I made the decision that I would completely rewrite Learn Your Lines. I'm still new at all this, and a rewrite allows me the opportunity to take all that I've learned to create an organized and stable application. It took longer than I expected (about 15 weeks) but I'm very pleased with how it turned out. I am now in the fortunate position to build upon what I've made. 

Laissez les bons temps rouler.
