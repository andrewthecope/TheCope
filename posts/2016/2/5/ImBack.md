### Some Backstory... ###
Unless you have been following my every move for the past 10 years, you probably don't remember that I made a website when I was eleven. I was in sixth grade and saw having a website as the epitome of cool (You can probably gather that I wasnâ€™t very cool). I registered for a Microsoft service called Office Live that offered free hosting and domain names for anyone with a valid credit card. I didn't have a credit card so I stole my Dad's out of the kitchen drawer when he wasn't looking (Sorry Dad).  In hindsight, I could have very easily asked my Dad to fund my pursuits for the low cost of zero dollars, but that seemed like too much trouble.

### Why TheCope.net? ###
I'll admit that it's not the best domain name, but I have been paying for this domain for a long time and I have grown fond of it. It all started when I couldn't find any combination of `andrew` and `cope` available for a domain name. Nowadays I would probably spring for a fancy TLD like .cool or .ninja, but the world was a different (less awesome) place back then. Why ***The*** Cope? Who knows, I was a weird kid. 

### The Place to Get Awesome ###
I absolutely loved my little website.  
The tagline of my website: *The Place to Get Awesome*. 
The color scheme: Green and Orange (I was convinced that looked good). The content on the site: Nothing really. I embedded lots of flash games. I had competitions like "Cool Person of the 1/2 Month" where I would showcase cool people who filled out a web form. I briefly experimented with a idea for a talk show called "The Show to Get Awesome", but that one never made it past the pilot. 


I look back on my old TheCope.net days very fondly. I didn't know what I was doing, but TheCope.net gave me a place to figure things out. It was my nerdy playground. I'm 19 now (not very old but older than I've ever been before), and I hope to keep this kind of experimentation with me for as long as I can. 

Which brings me to a new iteration of TheCope.net, the website you are reading right now. Consider this my new playground, where I experiment with design, code, and writing. I'd rather no one ever read this, but since you've already made it this far, don't judge anything on here too harshly. I just want to play around.
