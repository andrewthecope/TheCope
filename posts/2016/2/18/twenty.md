Today marks the day where I become an old person. I turn 20 today.

Save your responses that will go something like "you're still young!", "it's just another year!", or "this birthday just seems disproportionally large because we use a base-10 numbering system". I know. Regardless, I am feeling notably anxious with the reality of being a 20-year-old. 

To me, it seems like today marks the end of the first chapter of my life. I'm very pleased with all that I have done in Chapter 1 of *The Life and Times of Andrew James Cope*, but it is strange to think that the first segment is written and finalized. 

But as one chapter ends, a new one begins. In my moping about being an old person, all I can do is build on my previous accomplishments and do something worthy of Chapter 2. I feel more motivation than ever to learn, think, and create. There's so much to do, and still plenty of time to do it all. 

So I guess I better get to work.
