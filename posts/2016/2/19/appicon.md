@@ Title=Thinking About an App Icon@@ Date=February 19, 2016I've never really been happy with the Learn Your Lines app icon. In my rush to upload version 1.0 to the App Store, I didn't give the icon the attention I would have liked under normal circumstances. Here is the 1.0 version:<img src="http://www.thecope.net/AppIconPost/icon1.png" alt="1.0 App Icon" width=100px>*Before I get into it, let me note that I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about. I really know nothing about graphic design (or anything for that matter). I'm just keeping a record of what I'm currently thinking about. This is the beauty of having a blog that no one will read.*### In Defense of a Not-That-Great IconI find the general design (three colored rectangles on a blue background) to be distinctive enough to stand out on the home screen. Even in a sea of other blue icons, it still remains unique and compelling. But looking more critically, there are many details I didn't fully consider that make the icon sloppy and unattractive. Let me break it down:### Margin SpacingIf I draw a box around the three inner lines, it turns out that there is more vertical margin space than horizontal margin space. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but I find it to be unattractive. This is backed up by Apple's own design guidelines which stress the importance of using a grid as the basis for design. So adjust the inner space elements to make the margins even. Sounds simple enough. The next problem turns out be less simple. ### The ColorsLook at the where the blue and red colors meet. I don't know how to explain it, but do you see that darkness where the colors touch? This is possibly a problem solved by taking a design class on color theory, but I have no idea why this happens. Despite googling like a mad-man about this, I am still stumped. The best I can do is copy the colors from professionally designed logos and call it a day. So, I stole the colors from the Google logo (tweaked just a little bit).  <img src="http://www.thecope.net/AppIconPost/googleicon.png" alt="Google Logo" width=200px>Which leads us to this updated icon:<img src="http://www.thecope.net/AppIconPost/icon2.png" alt="2.0 App Icon" width=100px>The red-blue color clash is still present (and I'm perpetually annoyed by it), but the new colors stolen from the Google logo help the whole thing look much more balanced. I feel these colors bring the different elements together as a unit. (What do you know? Professional designers know more than a 20 year old with a computer).### A GradientApple makes no specific remark about background gradients in their design guidelines, but gradients are a notable part of the iOS app icon world. When first designing the app, I decided to go completely gradient-less. It matched the UI design of the app, and I deemed gradients ugly. Well, I change my mind. I've added a slight gradient in the background.  ### Shadow EffectsTo help augment the color clash issue, I experimented with subtle inner shadows on the three inner rectangles. This helps to offset the darkness of the color clash, and looks cool. I think of all the things discussed in the post, there is much more experimentation to be done with shadow effects, but for now, I'm adding it in. ### Updated DesignSo after spending more time considering the icon, this is my updated design.<img src="http://www.thecope.net/AppIconPost/icon3.png" alt="final App Icon" width=100px>There's more to critique, but (for now anyway) I am satisfied. The new icon will be included in the upcoming 2.0 release of the app. Out of Photoshop and back into Xcode for me!
