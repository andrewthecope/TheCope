For whatever reason, the download numbers for Learn Your Lines continue to climb at a steady rate. I watch the numbers very closely not because they are particuarly interesting, but rather because I can think of no greater motivator than the possibility of helping people.

I have found great joy in the programming and design challenges of creating Learn Your Lines, but what really motivates me to work hard is the people who use the app. I've gotten many emails from users suggesting features and reporting bugs. I get a delight everytime I get one of these emails because it proves that someone out there is having a positive expirience with something I made. I have the unique opportunity to help people (in a small way, I know I'm not curing cancer here), and that motivates me to spend more time creating. 

And this is the beauty of software. A fixed amount of work can be useful to an essentially unlimited amount of people. Not everyone understands why I like programming and this is the best explanation I can come up with. I can make things and influence people from the comfort of my own bedroom.

As I begin to narrow down the things I want to do with my life, I know that I will always want "making stuff for people" to be part of the job description. I've gotten a small glimpse at a life that satisfies me and I intend to chase after it.
