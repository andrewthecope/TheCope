I figured it was worth giving an update on what I've been working on these past couple months. Since July, I've been hard at work making a new app called (wait for it) "Number 2: Social Pooping for the 21st Century". Before you react, watch this demo. This is the greatest thing you will ever see.

Well, it is my duty to report that you will never see this app in the App Store. According to Apple, "A Social Network for Pooping is not suitable for the iMessage App Store". I tried my best to finagle, but to no avail. The old crusties at Apple App Review are just not "with it". I made this app in my desire to serve a new generation of people who have grown comfortable about the subject of pooping. We all do it, and the youth of today have rejected their parent's puritanical views on the subject. I was just hoping to make something fun for this new generation. 

I could continue wallowing about the wasted 4 months of my life, but this is not about me. This is about ALL OF US.

I hope that this little app didn't die in vain. I hope that this killing will spark a conversation worldwide about the stigma surrounding pooping. I speak on behalf of a new generation trying desperately to take control of our own natural processes that our forefathers have shamed us into desparaging:
