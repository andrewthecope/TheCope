@@ Title=Dialogues: Read Mode
@@ Date=December 27, 2016

I have finished that input screen [I wrote about a week ago](http://www.thecope.net/2016/12/20/dialogues-input). I considered writing a post about the finished screen (and I still might later), but for now, I will [keep moving forward](https://youtu.be/LmW3H-EXYS0). The next stop on my journey is "Read Mode".

The purpose of Read Mode is to become familiar with text by reading it three times. A few emailers have told me that three repetitions is too few to make meaningful progress, but for now, I stand by it. 

For speeches and monologues, Read Mode follows a "Listen and Repeat" model. The question when adapting this mode for dialogues is what gets read, the cue line or the line? 

Here's the options:

1. The app reads the cue line, the user reads the line back. This repeats three times. 
2. Ignore the cue line in Read Mode and do "Listen and Repeat" with the line itself. 
3. The app reads the cue line once, the user reads the line back three times.



Option 1 seems the most natural. The app plays the role of the scene-partner, and the user responds back. The problem scenario I can imagine is this:

Cue line: `Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah.`<br>Line: `"Ok, sure."`

With option 1, the user will have to listen to the long cue line over and over again, just to say "Ok, sure". I would find this frustrating.

Option 2 takes the cue line out entirely and reads the line itself. This most closely mimicks Read More for monologues, but I think it is important to associate a line with a cue line. 

Which brings me to option 3. Since the cue line is not really that important, it might be best to read it once, and then have the user repeat the line three times. This may be unituitive, but it's the best I can think of right now. 

Off to Xcode for me. I'll report back.
