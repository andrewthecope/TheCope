@@ Title=Dialogues: Memorize Mode
@@ Date=December 30, 2016

For those just tuning in, I am currently working to adding support for dialogues in Learn Your Lines. Previously I have written about the [Input Screen](http://www.thecope.net/2016/12/20/dialogues-input) and [Read Mode](http://www.thecope.net/2016/12/27/dialogues-read). The goal is to finish before I start school again on January 9th. So far so good, but we'll see how it goes.

Next up on our journey, Memorize Mode. This should be a piece of cake (I'm knocking the wood surface of my desk as I type this).

Memorize Mode is comprised of horizontal scrolling cards that I internally call MemorizeCards. All I need to do is add the cue line to each MemorizeCard. The blurring and reveal code will not change. 

I have some big plans for the next step, Test Mode, so hopefully I can finish this up quickly.
