Learn Your Lines is the easiest, simplest, and most fun way to memorize text. Whether it be a presentation, monologue, poem, or speech, you will impress your boss, teacher, or audience with your memorizing prowess. Memorize at your desk, on your commute, or while you are falling asleep. It has never been easier.

It turns out that we are all extremely capable of memorizing quickly. We just suffer from a poor process or lack of motivation. Learn Your Lines is thoughtfully designed to make memorizing simple and fun.

Here is how it works:

**Input Text:**
Just paste text into Learn Your Lines, and the app will do the rest. Your text will be intelligently broken down into bite-sized chunks to make memorization easy.

**Read Mode:**
Learn Your Lines helps familiarize you with the text. Listen as a phrase is read, and then repeat back.

**Memorize Mode:**
Next, you’ll be given one phrase at a time with some words blurred out. Still don’t know it? No problem: just tap-and-hold to reveal the blurred text. Learn Your Lines keeps track of which phrases you have learned, so you memorize efficiently.

**Test Mode:**
Once you have memorized each phrase, it is time to put it all together. Each time you advance to the the next level, more words will be blurred out until everything is concealed.

**Final Exam:**
Learn Your Lines has a voice recorder feature to test and time to your delivery. 

Now, you can face your audience with confidence!
